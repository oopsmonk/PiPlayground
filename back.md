Chris: Which colleges are you applying to?    
  
Marcella: None. I can't afford to go to college. Even if I lived at home, [tuition][1], fees, and books are just too expensive.    
  
Chris: You could apply for [financial aid][2].    
  
Marcella: I don't want to get a bunch of loans and be in debt for the next 10 to 20 years. It's not worth it.    
  
Chris: Loans aren't so bad, especially ones that are [federally][3] [subsidized][4].  Apart from that, you could get need-based [grants][5] or [work-study][6]. Put all of that together and college can be affordable.    
  
Marcella: I don't want to go into debt of any kind.    
  
Chris: You could go to a community college and transfer to a four-year university after two years. Community college tuition is much lower.    
  
Marcella: But who has the time? I have to work full-time to pay my bills.    
  
Chris: Then think about a program that has a service [commitment][7].    
  
Marcella: What do you mean?    
  
Chris: There are teaching, military, or community service programs that will forgive or pay off your loans if you work for the organization for a few years after graduating.    
  
Marcella: And be an [indentured][8] [servant][9]? No, thank you!    
  
Chris: Okay, but most good jobs nowadays require a college degree.    
  
Marcella: Not if you really have talent    
  
Chris: Talent?    
  
Marcella: Yeah, haven't you seen me [mime][10]? That's my ticket to a great career.    
  
Chris: I'm happy to hear you have such a practical plan mapped out of your future.

[Grant vs. Subsidy](http://smallbusiness.chron.com/whats-difference-between-grant-subsidy-39285.html)    
Grants are sums that usually do not have to be repaid but are to be used for defined purposes. Subsidies, on the other hand, refer to direct contributions, tax breaks and other special assistance that governments provide businesses to offset operating costs over a lengthy time period.
